This painting inspires me the power of the elements on humans, more precisely here, that of water.
Its strength has two sides, whether you go with or against the flow, which is depicted here by the alternance of bright and dark features.
The viewer can also see the universe.
The painting is willingly free of horizon in order to highlight the confusion between both fluids.
